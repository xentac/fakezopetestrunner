This package provides a flexible test runner with layer support.


Getting started
***************

zope.testrunner uses buildout.  To start, run ``python bootstrap.py``.  It will
create a number of directories and the ``bin/buildout`` script.  Next, run
``bin/buildout``.  It will create a test script for you.  Now, run ``bin/test``
to run the zope.testrunner test suite.
